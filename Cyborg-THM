Try Hack Me -: Cyborg
Compromise the machine and read the user.txt and root.txt

Q1:
Scan the machine, how many ports are open?

So for this one i ran NMAP -sS -sC -T4 {IP} command to find out what ports are open

(NMAP SS)


```
Anwser -: 2
```

Q2:
What service is running on port 22?

This is a very simple question as anyone that is familiar with Port numbers will know its protocol
but if you are not familiar what port 22 is the scan you performed earlier will reveal the anwser to you 
```
Anwser -: ssh
```

Q3:
What service is running on port 80?

Yet again knowledge with what protocol has what Port Number is a big help here, but yet again the scan you did earlier will tel you what it is.

```
Anwser -: http
```



As we now know what ports it has open you can go and check them out!
for instance we know SSH will require us to enter password so we can leave that one alone, BUT 
port 80 is up so we can go onto our browser type IP into it and see what the result is...

(BROWSER SS)


Q4:
What is the user.txt flag?

For this one i ran Gobuster to see what directories are avalible for our site

(GOBUSTER SS)

now we know we have ADMIN, ETC and Server-Status avalible so lets start with ADMIN
